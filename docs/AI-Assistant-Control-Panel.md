# ðŸ§­ AI Assistant Control Panel - Project Overview

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal
Build a fully integrated **AI Assistant Control Panel** with both:
- A **React + Tailwind frontend** for interaction and status display
- A **FastAPI backend** to handle configuration, execution, and delegation of tasks
- A **Local AI Assistant** that executes system-level commands and interacts with the frontend/backend

The project emphasizes:
- Modular structure
- Upgradeable and replaceable components
- Immediate usability with room for growth

---

## âœ… Completed Milestones

### ðŸ§  Local Assistant Core
- Voice Assistant using Google Speech Recognition + Zira TTS
- Modular config with `config.json`
- Assistant logic implemented in `VoiceAssistantWithTasks.py`
- Plain-text task ingestion using `task.txt`
- Output feedback using `status.json`
- Reusable task execution logic in `task_monitor.py`
- Successfully running inside `.venv`

### ðŸ›  Task Automation System
- Open VSCode
- Run Backend (Uvicorn)
- Run Frontend (Vite dev server)
- Install Backend Dependencies
- Install Frontend Dependencies
- Open Backend/Frontend Folders
- Git Pull in project root
- Feedback shown via `status.json`

### ðŸ“¦ Environment
- Unified Python environment (`.venv`) for Assistant and backend
- Manual `pyaudio` installation completed
- Full Assistant lifecycle tested and working

## ðŸš§ Tasks in Progress / Next Priorities

### 1. ðŸ”— Backend Integration (FastAPI)
- [ ] Create FastAPI service to accept API requests (e.g., POST /run-task)
- [ ] Internally use `task_monitor.run_task(task)` directly
- [ ] Serve `status.json` to the frontend
- [ ] Return live JSON feedback to web UI

### 2. ðŸ’» Frontend (React + Tailwind)
- [ ] Task input form + submit button
- [ ] Status display (read `status.json` or API endpoint)
- [ ] Dashboard with toggles for models, modes (online/offline)
- [ ] Visual indication of Assistant status (idle / speaking / executing)

### 3. ðŸ§  Assistant Enhancements
- [ ] Add task history logger (`log.txt`)
- [ ] Add support for compound tasks or task chaining
- [ ] Enable voice-triggered system commands ("Run backend", etc.)
- [ ] Dynamic task routing via keywords or rules

### 4. ðŸ“¦ Packaging and Startup
- [ ] Create `requirements.txt` (freeze dependencies)
- [ ] Add `start_all.bat` to launch Assistant and backend
- [ ] Optionally support system tray icon or taskbar launcher

## ðŸ“˜ Notes
- The Local Assistant can be seen as the "execution agent"
- The backend will act as a "brainstem" and decision layer
- The frontend will provide a user-friendly interface, feedback, and interactivity

## âœ… You Are Here
Full Assistant functionality is live. Ready to start integrating into backend.

Letâ€™s now proceed with building out the backend and wiring it to the Assistant!
